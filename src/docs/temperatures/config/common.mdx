# Common Configuration

`temperatures-common.toml` allows you to control how temperatures are calculated.

## `biomeTemperatures`

This is a list of biome entries, which are formatted as: `[biomeName, dayTemperature, nightTemperature]`. 

The day or night temperature can be any number between -2 and 2, with decimals. Here are how the player reacts to certain temperatures:
- `|x| = 3`: The player will require Flame or Ice breaker.
- `2 > |x| >= 1.5`: The player requires Level II protection.
- `1.5 > |x| >= 1.0`: The player requires Level I protection.
- `1.0 > |x|`: The player requires no protection.

When setting these values, remember to consider other determinants (i.e. rain, snow, or ambient blocks).

**Default Value**
```toml
[]
```

**Example**
```toml
biomeTemperatures = [
    ["minecraft:taiga", -1, -2],
    ["minecraft:desert", 1, -1]
]
```

## `warmBlocks`

This option configures blocks that change the temperature of players around them. Despite its name, it allows you to lower temperatures as well.

It is in the format of `[blockId, temperatureDifference]`. 

Note that these do not stack. If a player is around a block that adds 0.5 temperature, and another one that adds 1.0 temperature, they will only receive 1.0 temperature.
This behaviour changes if the player is surrounded by both warm and cool blocks: the sum will be considered.

**Default Value & Example**
```toml
warmBlocks = [
    ["minecraft:campfire", 0.5],
    ["minecraft:fire", 1.0],
    ["minecraft:lava", 1.0]
]
```

## `diffInRain` and `diffInSnow`

Determines how to offset the player's temperature in rain and snow, respectively.

**Default Value**
```toml
diffInRain = -0.5
diffInSnow = -0.5
```
