# Signals

Î¼Signal was originally built to support same-sided events. Learn how to use them here.

## What's the difference between a `SignalNode` and `Signal`?

SignalNodes *only* handle connections, and do not support firing or viewing its connections.
This was designed so that libraries could expose an event without allowing users to fire it.

## Using Signals

To create a signal, use the `new()` constructor. You may ignore the `flags` parameter for now.
Signals behave the same as nodes, with one addition: it exposes a `:Fire()` method you can use to call
all of its listeners.

```lua
local signal = uSignal.new()

signal += function(arg)
    print("Hello, " + arg + "!")
end

-- Classic syntax
signal:Fire("Argument")

-- CS syntax
signal("Argument")
```

## Dispatch Mode

Roblox is in the process of updating all of their events to be deferred instead of being ran immediately.
In short, this causes all events to fire at once, at the end of a frame.

If you'd like to use this style of event, you can pass in the `DISPATCH` flag to `uSignal.new()`: 

```lua
local signal = uSignal.new(uSignal.DISPATCH)
```

## Other Supported Operations

Signals expose their connections publicly. You may access them using `Signal.Connections`. Alternatively,
you can iterate over the signal object itself:

```lua
local signal = uSignal.new()

signal += listener1
signal += listener2

for _, listener in signal do
    print("Listener:", listener)
end
```

You may also get the number of listeners by using the length operator:

```lua
local signal = uSignal.new()

print(#signal) -- 0

signal += listener
print(#signal) -- 1
```
