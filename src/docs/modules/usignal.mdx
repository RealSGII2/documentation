## Introduction

Everything in this library is a `SignalNode`, which allows connections to be added and removed.
There are two different syntaxes: *classic*, and *cs*:

```lua
-- Classic syntax
signal:Connect(listener)
signal:Disconnect(listener)
signal:Once(listener)

-- CS syntax
signal += listener -- Connect
signal -= listener -- Disconnect
signal %= listener -- Once
signal *= listener -- Also once
```

Note that `SignalNode`s may only be connected to. If you want to fire them, look into the following classes:
- **Signals** are intended to be used on a singular network side, like a BindableEvent. 
- **Events** are intended to cross the network boundary, like a RemoteEvent.
