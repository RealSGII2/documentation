# DocEngine 2

![Doc Engine Two](/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fhero%2FdocEngine2Banner.png&w=1920&q=75)

Version two of the documentation engine I built for a company.

This version is intended to fix several things I was unsatisfied with in the original version:
- Not the best performance
    - The content is always pulled via a remote repo. In this version, it is compiled.
- A tedious file naming scheme
- Strict "rules" when making structure
