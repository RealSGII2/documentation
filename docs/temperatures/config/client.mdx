# Client Configuration

`temperatures-client.toml` allows you to control the GUI, disable warnings, and view debug information.

## `debug`

When enabled, debug information is shown on screen. This is useful for seeing exact temperature information, and how it's determined.

**Command** `/temperatures debug [true/false]`

**Default Value** `false`

## `muteConfigWarnings`

When a player joins, and their configuration doesn't list all loaded biomes, they'll see a warning in chat and a link to automatically populate the missing biomes.
Setting this to `true` hides this warning.

**Command** `/temperatures mute-config-warning [true/false]`

**Default Value** `false`

## `gui`

This section configures the position of the temperature gauge. If you'd like a visual editor, it is recommended to run `/temperatures position`.

## `gui.anchorPoint`

The location on screen to base `offsetX` and `offsetY` off of.

**Default Value** `"BOTTOM_RIGHT"`

## `gui.offsetX` and `gui.offsetY`

The amount to move the gauge from the `anchorPoint`.

Note that depending on the value of `anchorPoint`, these values may be mirrored, eliminating the need for minus signs.
