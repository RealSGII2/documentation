# Configuration

Temperatures allows extensive customisation through its configuration.

There are three configuration files:
- The [common configuration](/temperatures/config/common) controls how temperature is calculated.
- The [client configuration](/temperatures/config/client) controls how the GUI is rendered, shows debug information, and controls if configuration warnings are emitted.
- The [server configuration](/temperatures/config/server) determines how fast and how much damage players take when in uncomfortable or extreme conditions.

## Default Configuration

This mod does not ship with default temperature configurations. When you join, you'll see a warning in chat mentioning this.
It'll provide an option to automatically fill the configuration with all the biomes. You can fill it out manually, but I've seen
people use an AI to fill it as well.
